  ðŸ‘‹ My name is Hao-Wei. I am a research assistant at National [Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/) at [Theta Lab](http://theta.cs.nthu.edu.tw/) advised by Prof. **Yiyu Shi** at the [Unversity of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). During my B.S study, I interned at AMD and Point Robotics. Right now, I am applying for M.S. and Ph.D. programs in Computer Science in the U.S. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

Research Interest
======
My primary areas of interest in research are connecting robustness, generalization, and individual fairness, through the unsupervised or weakly supervised. Moreover, I am also interested in the fusion of computer vision and medical imaging.
