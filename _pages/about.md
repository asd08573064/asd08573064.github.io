  ðŸ‘‹ My name is Hao-Wei. I am a research assistant at National [Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/) at [Theta Lab](http://theta.cs.nthu.edu.tw/) advised by Prof. **Yiyu Shi** at the [Unversity of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). During my B.S study, I interned at AMD and Point Robotics. Right now, I am applying for M.S. and Ph.D. programs in Computer Science in the U.S. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

My primary areas of interest in research are connecting robustness, generalization, and individual fairness, through the unsupervised or weakly supervised learning. Moreover, I am also interested in the fusion of computer vision and medical imaging.
