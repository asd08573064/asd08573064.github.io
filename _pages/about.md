 ðŸ‘‹ My name is Hao-Wei, I am a research assistant at National [Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/) at [Theta Lab](http://theta.cs.nthu.edu.tw/) advices by Prof. **Yiyu Shi** at the [Unversity of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/).  During my B.S study, I interned at AMD and Point Robotics. My primary areas of interest in research are AI fairness and computer vision ðŸ‘€ in medical field. Currently, I am conducting research on AI Fairness on dermatological task and submitted my first co-author paper about AI fairness to ICLR2023. I plan to extend my work to a unsupervised manner (without any sensitive attributes). Also, right now, I am applying for M.S. and Phd programs in Computer Science in the U.S. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
