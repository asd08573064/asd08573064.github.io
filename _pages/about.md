 👋 My name is Hao-Wei, I am a research assistant at National Tsing Hua University at Theta Lab. My research mainly focus on Medical AI and Computer Vision  👀  👀. Currently, I am conducting research on AI Fairness on dermatological task and submitted my first co-author paper about AI fairness to ICLR2023. I planning to extend this to a unsupervised manner (without any sensitive attributes). Also, I am applying for M.S. and Phd programs in Computer Science in the U.S. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
