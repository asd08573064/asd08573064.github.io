Actively looking for 2024 summer internship.

ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, I'm Hao-Wei, a dedicated software engineer driven by a profound passion for machine learning and data science. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from National Tsing Hua University. I am currently pursuing a master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University in Computational Data Science program. 
  
As a former research assistant at National [Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/) at [Theta Lab](http://theta.cs.nthu.edu.tw/), I focused on connecting robustness, generalization, and fairness, through the unsupervised or weakly supervised learning manners in medical domain and yielded two research papers at top conferences (AAAI, MICCAI) of machine learning.

Throughout my internship at AMD, I designed and implemented an internal Image Signal Processor (ISP) tuning platform that significantly improved imaging algorithm efficiency. My time at AMD has equipped me with a practical understanding of software engineering and a commitment to optimizing solutions.

I am enthusiastic about leveraging my expertise and adept problem-solving skills on a global scale. Currently, I am in active pursuit of a summer internship opportunity within the United States. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me to talk about potential software engineering openings.
