   * Last 60 Units GPA: 4.24/4.3
   * Award: Academic Excellence Award for the top 5% students in the department of Computer Science


Work experience
======

* Sep. 2022 -- Now: Research Assistant
  * National Tsing Hua University
  * Conduct research on fair representation learning on medical images and natural images.
  * Proposed a Multi-Exit debias CNN framework on CelebA \& UTK dataset.
  * Achieve state-of-the-art within the trade-off between accuracy and fairness.
  * Improved fairness metric in 20% while losing 0.13% in accuracy.
  * The work is under review by ICLR2023.
  
* Jan. 2022 -- Aug. 2022: SWE Intern
  * AMD
  * Built an ISP tuning tool that assisted more than 20 engineers across Taiwan and China on verifying and calibrating their imaging algorithms.
  * Built the tuning platform with C++, Python, Numpy, PyQt, CPython, and Visual Studio.
  * Designed and built a pivotal data conversion feature for raw image database that saved 90\% tuning time.
  * Developed the tuning UI that assisted engineers to do high-level tuning and saved 50\% developing time.

* Jul. 2020 -- Feb. 2020: Teaching Assistant of Logic Design Laboratory
  * Assisted professor to mark the exams and assign the homework and helped students in studying FPGA and Verilog.

* Jul. 2020 -- Aug. 2020: SWE Intern
  * POINT Robotic
  * Improved the product algorithm with OpenCV and non-learning-based image processing methods.
  * Added new manual labeling feature to object detection algorithm that provided flexibility to users.
